# Masterball (icirr.us)

Repository for my Pok&eacute;mon website. Been online since February 2017, started archiving my changes in October 2024.

This is a website that serves to log with my history with the Pok&eacute;mon franchise&mdash;as an avid player since 2004, it eventually occurred to me that it would be pretty neat to preserve all of my parties across each game onto a website. So this is what that's for, along with some fun stuff about me and a small Pok&eacute;mon Go section. This website is always subject to change as time goes on.
