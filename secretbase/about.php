	<h2>About</h2>

<p><span>Though not intentionally, I constructed this section around the eighth anniversary of this website, in February 2025. I'm the type of person who prefers buying merch with things I like on it over designs that I find too commonplace or have little to no meaning for me. So I own a lot of Pok&eacute;mon merch.</span></p>

<p><span>There's two major events that I cite quite often in my blurbs around here: my traveling during 2016, and a flood that I experienced in 2021. In 2016 I was doing a lot of traveling after dropping out of college for the first time. I decided to go to Hong Kong and do a lot of bargain shopping for a lot of East Asian merch, which I was obsessed with at the time (Haikyuu!!, Love Live!, a lot of other sports anime, and of course, Pok&eacute;mon). My plans also included going to Osaka, Japan, just for two days, and only to visit the Pok&eacute;mon Center store.</span></p>

<p><span>And so I did that too. I bought a lot, though at least 60% of my purchases were gifts for my friends, rather than for me. But I still purchased several things for myself, which you'll see here.</span></p>

<p><span>However, in 2021, when I was in an in-between stage of moving, the space that had been storing the majority of my material possessions got flooded, and I ended up losing a great deal of things that meant a lot to me through that. Some items I recovered, but a lot I didn't. Most of the plushies here witnessed that flood, but there were some I couldn't recover for my own health and safety. So there's probably a landfill somewhere with my old ruined Pok&eacute;mon merch.</span></p>

<p><span>Still, I like owning things and spending money I may or may not have, so my collection is quite abundant here regardless. I'm a materialistic Pok&eacute;mon fan, what can I say.</span></p>

<h2>Things I Used To Own</h2>

<p><span>Some of these I've only recently misplaced, while others are gone and only exist in my memory.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>A terrycloth substitute hoodie. I still have selfies of myself wearing it.</span></li>
	<li><span>My Luvdisc Original Stitch facemask. (It's somewhere, I used it on my recent vacation...)</span></li>
	<li><span>My small Darumaka plush. (He's somewhere in my apartment too...)</span></li>
	<li><span>A pastel Cyndaquil plushie keychain. I bought this in memory of my friend who passed away in 2016; though she knew very little about Pok&eacute;mon, Cyndaquil had always been her favorite. This one still might be around somewhere, but as the memory was more important to me than the plushie itself, I can always replace it with a new one.</span></li>
	<li><span>My Sylveon sleeping plushie, to fit with my old X team. I think this one got lost in the flood, so I might replace it just for completion.</span></li>
	<li><span>A reversible Ditto-Snorlax plush. Lost in the flood.</span></li>
	<li><span>My old red Gardevoir/Gallade phone case. This was on the phone I had prior to the one in my Latios and Latios phone case, but I think I left that phone with my mother after I'd moved out.</span></li>
	<li><span>Cynthia and Caitlin themed t-shirt. Lost in the flood.</span></li>
	<li><span>Cynthia and Caitlin themed drinking glasses. I bought these twice because they kept breaking in the dishwasher, but after they broke again (and after the flood, I think), I stopped replacing them. The online store that I bought them from has been shut down since covid, anyway.</span></li>
</ul>
