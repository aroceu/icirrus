	<h2>About</h2>

<p><span>Though not intentionally, I constructed the Secret Base around the eighth anniversary of this website, in February 2025.</span></p>

<p><span>I'm only an occasional shopping addict because I like collecting things. I'm also the type of person who prefers buying everyday items with a design that means something to me, especially over anything that I find to appear too commonplace or uninteresting. And I love stuffed animals. So I own a lot of Pok&eacute;mon merch.</span></p>

<p><span>There are two major events that I cite quite often in my blurbs around here: my traveling during 2016, and a flood that I experienced in 2021. In 2016 I was doing a lot of traveling, and visited Hong Kong primarily to visit my friend Cathy and go bargain shopping together for East Asian media merchandise. I was obsessed with several at the time &mdash; Haikyuu!!, Love Live!, a lot of other sports anime. And of course, Pok&eacute;mon.</span></p>

<p><span>My plans also included going to Osaka, Japan, just for two days, and only to visit the Pok&eacute;mon Center store. And so I did. I bought a lot, though at least 60% of my purchases were gifts for my friends, rather than for me. But I still purchased quite a bit for myself, which you'll see here.</span></p>

<p><span>In 2021, while I was in the middle of figuring out my living situation and moving, the space that had been storing the majority of the things I owned got flooded, and I ended up losing a great deal of my possessions because of it. Some items I recovered, but a lot I didn't. Most of the plushies here witnessed that flood, but there were some I couldn't recover for my own health and safety. So there's probably a landfill somewhere with my old ruined Pok&eacute;mon merch.</span></p>

<p><span>Still, I like owning things and spending money I may or may not have, so my collection is quite abundant here regardless. I'm a materialistic Pok&eacute;mon fan, what can I say.</span></p>

<h2>Used To Own</h2>

<p><span>Some of these I've only recently misplaced, while others are gone and only exist in my memory.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>A terrycloth substitute hoodie. I loved it a lot, but it got lost in the flood.</span></li>
	<li><span>My Luvdisc Original Stitch facemask. (It's somewhere, I used it on my recent vacation...)</span></li>
	<li><span>My small Darumaka plush. (He's somewhere in my apartment too...)</span></li>
	<li><span>A pastel Cyndaquil plushie keychain. I bought this in memory of a friend who passed away in 2016; though she knew very little about Pok&eacute;mon, Cyndaquil had always been her favorite. This one still might be around somewhere, but as the memory was more important to me than the plushie itself, I can always replace it with a new one.</span></li>
	<li><span>My Sylveon sleeping plushie, to fit with my old X team. I think this one got lost in the flood, so I might replace it just for completion.</span></li>
	<li><span>A reversible Ditto-Snorlax plush. Lost in the flood.</span></li>
	<li><span>My old red Gardevoir/Gallade phone case. This was on the phone I had prior to the one in my Latios and Latios phone case, but I think I left that phone with my mother after I'd moved out.</span></li>
	<li><span>Cynthia and Caitlin themed t-shirt. Lost in the flood.</span></li>
	<li><span>Cynthia and Caitlin themed drinking glasses. I bought these twice because they kept breaking in the dishwasher, but after they broke again (and after the flood, I think), I stopped replacing them. The online store that I bought them from has been shut down since covid, anyway.</span></li>
</ul>
