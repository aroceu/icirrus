	<p><span>The Amaura line was one of my top favorites in 2015-2020 and I'm still quite fond of it today. I love these two Amauras.</span></p>

	<p><span>Very unoriginally I adore the Alolan Vulpix line. The first one is an event plush from when I visited Osaka, and the other one I just find extremely cute. I used to have a third, but it got lost in the flood.</span></p>

	<p><span>Some event Pikachus I bought when I visited Osaka in 2016. I wasn't sure about buying the snowy one at the time because I had only started getting into the idea of collecting and didn't really care that much for Pikachu as a species. But now I'm beyond happy that I bought it because it's such a good and distinct design and makes me feel special in owning it.</span></p>

	<p><span>These are Pok&eacute;mon I'm extremely fond of in one way or another and wanted to get a plushie for. <strike.>If I find my Darumaka again, he would go here too.</strike.> Especially as I bought all of these during my 2016 Japan/Hong Kong trip, shortly after some Alolan Pok&eacute;mon were previewed - I saw Stufful and thought to myself, oh I need to get a plush of that guy immediately. And then I did.</span></p>

	<p><span>I bought this one during a visit to Texas (before I lived there). Though I don't have strong feelings about shiny mega Gardevoir in one way or another, I do like it and knew that seeing this in the wild was incredibly rare, so I snagged it anyway.</span></p>

	<p><span>Part of a (currently incomplete) set of Pok&eacute;mon that I bought purely due to my <i>Social Network</i> brainrot, since each of these Pok&eacute;mon remind me one of the main characters in one way or another. The only one missing is my Sylveon plushie, to complete the set. They're also my second <a href="https://icirr.us/trainer/x/" target="_blank">X team</a>.</span></p>
