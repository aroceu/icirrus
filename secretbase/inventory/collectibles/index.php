	<p><span>From the Splatoon 3 Water vs. Fire vs. Grass Pok&eacute;mon Splatfest in late 2022. I also received the Fire one, but mailed it to my friend Sani because she wanted it, since it's orange.</span></p>

	<p><span>Enamel pins that I bought from the Pok&eacute;mon Center during my trip to Osaka in 2016. They currently live on a small pink plastic bin that I use to hold other small trinkets.</span></p>

	<p><span>After getting into TCG Pocket, I bought this card so I would have at least one IRL Pok&eacute;mon card that meant something to me.</span></p>

	<p><span>I got these stickers as a part of a larger trainer sheet, and split it with Rae since I really just wanted these two.</span></p>

	<p><span>We were browsing some finger puppets for an Ampharos I could give to Sani (couldn't find one :c) and also someone who was digging for a Bronzong. We couldn't find either of those, but Rae and I did end up finding our own favorite Pok&eacute;mon. Not depicted here, hers is a Togekiss.</span></p>

	<p><span>I also got this Darumaka here, because he's funny.</span></p>

	<p><span>A fidget keycap! There were other options I liked, but the surprised Pikachu was calling to me. Helps with my ADHD, lol.</span></p>

	<p><span>Rae and I kept getting the sticker pack deals together; this was one I chose for a set of stickers she also wanted to buy. I love Goomy and I also take meds.</span></p>

	<p><span>I really wanted to get something masterball-themed at the con, and this one was perfect. I know how to crochet, but I also like to support artists :)</span></p>

	<p><span>This was a blind box; I liked all the options, but the Goomy one was my favorite. So Rae and I went through each box in the small bin and weighed them to find the one we thought would most likely contain the Goomys. And wouldn't you know it - we were right. </span></p>
