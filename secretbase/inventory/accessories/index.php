	<p><span>I'm a bandana wearer, though I haven't in recent years just due to having kept my hair short. But I do wear them when my hair is long, and so when I saw the Original Stitch collection was selling bandanas, I knew I had to get one. And then I got three.</span></p>

	<p><span>From Katsucon: Snom earrings because they're super cute as earrings; and a Goomy scrunchie because I liked the patterns so much and wanted to get something and Goomy was the Pok&eacute;mon I liked the most out of the selections. Good thing I like Goomy a lot.</span>
