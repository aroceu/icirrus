	<p><span>I really only care about getting clothing for my favorite Pok&eacute;mon and with designs that I genuinely like as clothing. So far I only have two, and for the same evolution line - my first and favorite starter, Treecko. The Sceptile shirt is from the Pok&eacute;mon Original Stitch collection, while the Treecko shirt was purchased fron Nintendo NYC.</span></p>

	<p><span>I used to own a terrycloth hoodie designed like the Substitute plush, but it got lost in a flood. To replace it I got a new Pok&eacute;mon hoodie in 2022, this time designed like Gengar. By the time I bought this, I had a lot more affinity for Gengar after gigantamax hunting it in Sword and Shield. I also own a lot of hoodies, but no purple ones, so it was also nice to have a full rainbow of hoodies after getting this one. I technically purchased it, but my sibling had given me the money for it :)</span></p>
