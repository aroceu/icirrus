<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>I made this website in February of 2017 and am writing this documentation on December 1 of 2024, so the details may be fuzzy or glossed over in parts. Additionally, my own coding ability (as well as thinking in more practical and strategic ways) has improved quite a bit since then &mdash; I hadn't studied computer science then, and I have for a couple of years now, though that doesn't make a huge improvement, really. But it's still a near 8-year gap.</p>

<p>Like I stated in the site info, I made Icirrus/Masterball because I'd always wanted to make a site dedicated to my love for Pok&eacute;mon, but for the longest time didn't know what. I love individual species, yes; I also love ships and characters and games. I like a lot of stuff about Pok&eacute;mon, but my biggest weakness when it comes to making sites based on things I love &mdash; and not just me &mdash; was the writing portion of it all. Don't get me wrong, I <i>love</i> writing. And I also love thinking. There's just a lot to write, and a lot to think about, and I'm a perfectionist and have an attention disorder so that's just not something I could ever really do. I'm far more interested in the designing aspect of making websites; writing the content is oftentimes an excuse to show off my designs.</p>

<p>And even then, I have my own hangups about my own design skills &mdash; mostly in that as much as I love looking at sites with elaborate graphics and banners, I also know it's not my calling as a webdesigner. I'm better off admiring them than making them, but otherwise I wanted to make something that I would feel confident and proud of making. And I know myself &mdash; though I may have had a vague interest in visual arts when I was younger, as many of my other hobbies and aspects of my life fell into place, I became someone who enjoyed looking at it more than creating it.</p>

<p>So where did this leave me, someone who likes making websites and Pok&eacute;mon but with my unique skill set? Well, in January of 2017 it occurred to me that my main love for Pok&eacute;mon was my history with each game, and therefore each party and Pok&eacute;mon I have. My brother was the one who liked resetting a lot &mdash; I never really reset, because once I played a game, it was the only time I'd play it. (Except for that one time where I had a bootleg copy of Emerald that would never save, so I played for long stretches of time.) But even still I moved my old Pok&eacute;mon to newer games and newer ways to have the be compatible with whatever's the latest game. My own Pok&eacute;mon are everything to me, and undoubtedly why I love the franchise so much in the first place.</p>

<p>So that was the idea: not a shrine to a particular aspect of Pok&eacute;mon, but rather to my relationship with it.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>My life at the time was in an in-between state. I'd dropped out of college (for the first time) a year and a half prior in 2015, and spent the majority of 2016 traveling with the excuse of finding myself, but mostly I used my credit card on trinkets I liked. Including a lot of Pok&eacute;mon plushies at the Osaka Pok&eacute;mon Center.</p>

<p>Maybe I was finding myself a little along the way.</p>

<p>Returning to live with my mom at the time was tumultuous for a lot of reasons I won't get into now; but one thing I will say was that it was a good excuse for me to sit on my ass and do nothing. Which meant it was a good time for my hobbies, particularly making websites. Since I genuinely had nothing else going on in my life, I made the majority of this website &mdash; particularly all the Trainer pages &mdash; in one siting because of this, as well as the Gym and Pok&eacute;Go pages and all their accompanying graphics. I've edited here and there, but the base skeleton of this website was made in 2017.</p>

<p>Which is also why the Trainer pages employ perhaps an incredibly inefficient and insane way of translating skins across different pages. I know now how to make it more practical, but eh. I'm not sure if it's a big deal at this rate. Still, yeah @ 2017 self, using root variables would <i>probably</i> be a little easier than whatever my current template.css has going on. Oh well. You live and you learn. (I might fix it one day, but no promises.)</p>

<p>The design for the trainer pages is simplistic, but that's the whole idea: the focus is on the Pok&eacute;mon, and what I find fun to share about them, and the feelings each page gives me. This website was never made for a "visitor," just for me &mdash; which is my whole mindset when creating websites in the first place. When I look at my favorite Pok&eacute;mon and my teams, I don't need things in the background to distract me, or even really anything beyond the Pok&eacute;mon themselves. Tell me the game it was, the year I played it, and a short little blurb of how I felt about it, and I'll get sent back to watching my camp friend playing Pok&eacute;mon Ruby on her GameBoy Advance in the gym (I'm still friends with her on Instagram), or that time I decided to play FireRed with only two Pok&eacute;mon, or all the complicated messy emotions I felt about my X team that I decided to run a team based on my hyperfixation with <i>The Social Network</i> 3 years later instead. It's a time capsule built for me, about me.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean I can't make it accessible, of course &mdash; but I'm getting ahead of myself here. Making this website was with a lot of my most basic skillsets, but not with enough contextual knowledge, so to speak. The code I had for the trainer page pop-up (which I retained until my most recent updateheaval, wherein I made it a separate page) was old school outdated code that I didn't realize until I asked about it on StackExchange. At least I could navigate my knowledge of tables, though it certainly didn't make me like tables any more.</p> 

<p>The Gym section provided its own issues as well &mdash; though I'd had an idea of what the Trainer pages would look like (either drawn out or abstracted in my head, who knows anymore), the "gym" was a lot less clear, though I knew I wanted it to have site information and maybe a Pok&eacute;mon Go section, because it was 2017 and I was still playing it avidly. "Run", of course, would have exit links out. The issue that made me realize how little I knew was the "Bag" section at the time &mdash; my ideal was to make it an in-page bag that could navigate in and out of the "Gym" menu, but I didn't trust my Javascript skills at the time so I figured, how hard could a "bag" page with some flavor text for a bike and open/close another map menu be? Pretty damn hard, I'll tell you that. That alone &mdash; particularly what I wanted the flavor text to do &mdash; took me an entire day to figure out, though I managed to make it work.</p>

<p>And with the fighting section I didn't have anything in mind, so I decided, fuck it, I can just go with a super basic look and make it work, because the rest of the site is kind of basic-looking anyway. What I want the appeal of this website to be isn't necessarily the elaboration of any design, but the elaboration of navigation. My favorite thing about any website I find cool is not only the design (though of course, a huge aspect of it), but also the experience. If the website itself is fun and interesting to experience, even if it's complicated or messy or a little bit ugly, then I'll love it. I love exploring websites and opening doors and finding secrets; and yes, I was an avid fan of I Spy games when I was younger. I had a game that I played repeatedly for an entire summer.</p>

<p>So that's the kind of approach I've always had for Masterball/Icirrus &mdash; make it an experience, fun, and about me. It doesn't have to make sense or be perfect as long as I'm happy with it. But &mdash; I suppose that's the approach I have with everything these days too.</p>

<h2 id="name">Name</h2>

<p>I talked about it a bit on the site info, but I'll go more into detail here because I do think it's integral to this site's identity. Because it's its name.</p>

<p>The site was originally named <i>MASTERBALL</i>, because it was hosted under my old domain &mdash; pkmn.arose.nu. I didn't have a domain for it, partially for financial reasons at the time, but also because even if I did, I didn't know if I wanted it to be something like masterball.com/org/net/info/whatever else. I didn't want its name to feel too tied to its identity &mdash; and I suppose this comes from my fear of permanence, with how incredibly indecisive I can be.</p>

<p>I picked the name "Masterball" in the first place because I'd been called "Pok&eacute;mon Master" as a nickname in 4th grade (when the older kids in my afterschool care gave everyone nicknames &mdash; that was me, Pok&eacute;mon Master), as well as the fact that it is indeed true that every time I've tried to cheat in my old games, the first mod I'd enable is an infinite supply of masterballs. What can I say, I've spent hours of my 9-year old life staring at Rayquaza and Registeels and wishing they'd stay in the goddamn ball.</p>

<p>Still was the element of commitment, and that's not exactly my strong suit. However, I did decide some years ago that Icirrus City is my favorite Pok&eacute;mon City of all time (though sometimes I forgot how to spell it) &mdash; only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TlmsGam4ks">because of its music</a>, though it is a banger. I love percussive as well as interactive elements, and this city adding claps into the music when you got close to the ring of NPCs dancing in-game was my favorite thing when I was 18; and still was when I was 23.</p>

<p>At the end of 2017 I moved out from my mom's and with some friends with the intention of returning to college (which would then be put on an indefinite hiatus so to speak, due to covid and my own personal ambitions). Though I didn't have a job at the time, I did have money because I was in school again (an agreement with my parents), and .us domains are pretty cheap, so...</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I'd been thinking about having <b>icirr.us</b> as its URL for a while &mdash; it was just a matter of committing to it. Especially as I'd decided to let arose.nu expire in 2018, so I'd need to move the Pok&eacute;mon section to a new domain regardless. I couldn't think of anything better in that time, anyway &mdash; I bought the domain over a year after I'd made most of the site in the first place. It was still a work-in-progress, anyway. Plus, like I've said in other places, I liked Pok&eacute;mon before I've even been online. Having it be its own separate website away from anything specifically IRL or "online" was its optimal place for me, and Masterball/Icirrus reflects that &mdash; not tied to me specificially, but still representative of something I love or feels reflective of my love for Pok&eacute;mon in some way.</p>

<p>I feel a little differently now, largely because I've decided that anything to do with my skills or interests with web development or design would be strictly hobbyist. Whenever I try to monetize the things I love, I hate it and I hate myself and also I just don't do it, so it's best for me to continue to enjoy the things I love and find something dull to make money instead. Which is where I'm currently at in my life, so good for me. And good for my websites, which I can now tie to my online identity with a bit more comfort.</p>

<p>It does have my IRL name and is the website I show to IRL people when they ask about the kind of websites I like to make, though, so you know. Your mileage may vary and whatnot.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

<p>Despite my memory being fuzzy, I do remember that I had sketched out the wireframe of this website, at least &mdash; though it may not make sense to the unsuspecting visitor, this website has always made sense to me in my head. I would have one section that would be the team archival aspect and everything related to my love for specific Pok&eacute;mon (Trainer), and another for everything else. Though for the moment, "everything else" was largely limited to only four possible options.</p>

<p>Icirrus/Masterball has always been a work in progress, though &mdash; not just in terms of development, but how I think of it in my head. I'm never gonna finish playing Pok&eacute;mon games, you know; and in the same vein, I know I'm capable of thinking of more creative things to implement that may not come to me now. So I didn't fuss about the future, because I knew I would end up adding more anyway. I always do.</p>

<p>Much like many of my other websites, I started by writing everything in HTML, and then converting to a separate stylesheet, and then PHP later. Of course, in this pre-root variable era for me, the stylesheet became quite bloated, but I didn't really realize at the time. (Nor do I care much even now.) The graphics in particular were actually quite fun, mostly because it required for me to find the particular image &mdash; I wanted them to be game-specific as well, and not just the most recent sprite for a game I played in 2004. I enjoyed making the trainer graphics as well, because I do almost always play as the girl &mdash; and I like their designs a lot, so it's fun to pick how I want them to appear on the page, especially as reminiscent of my experience with the game. For example, I used a small pixelated sprite for May in my Ruby page, but the high def PNG in my Omega Ruby page, because those are the games those specific avatars are tied to. Other game-specific stuff that I translated (though may not have necessarily enjoyed and mostly did out of completion) were the specific balls I had caught each Pok&eacute;mon in, and their ribbons.</p>

<p>That was the matter of thinking it through though, while the moves, though functionally useless (and not very good from a competitive standpoint), were just fun to add on the page and make a little dropdown box. I also went with blurbs for each games rather than anything longer, because I'm self-conscious about writing about myself in long-form (which may not be as evident here) and wanted to talk about my experiences with each game in a digestible way that wouldn't require for you to stay on a webpage that may not be best to read on for too long.</p>

<p>I gathered all the images offline; I actually constructed the pages/folders I was coding on locally to work in the same way it would online, which I tend to do for larger projects like this anyway. I don't quite remember when I made the index page (and its accompanying graphics), though 7 years later I think I did a great job and wouldn't want to change it unless I got inspiration for something better. I genuinely don't remember what technique I used to make the code and graphics work &mdash; if I borrowed someone else's logic, or used image mapping, or just figured it out on my own &mdash; but damn, it still holds up today. Thanks past me.</p>

<p>The specialized pastel graphics I made are quite fun as well. It wasn't part of the original plan I believe, but the more I created this pastel 2D masterball aesthetic, the easier it was for me to make graphics with the same motif. Like I said before, I'm not much of a visual artist &mdash; but this is more vectoring than anything, and with a pretty simplistic shape to go off and a distinct design, it took a good amount of creativity that I was more comfortable with than not. Plus, I had a student copy of Photoshop.</p>

<p>I like having all the trainer game pages having such vastly different colors despite following the same template. When I was younger, for my second main domain I tried to do something similar, but for my different hobbies online. I'd always liked the idea of making a bunch of differently colored and stylized websites all under the same umbrella; but doing it for my hobbies felt like I was splintering myself apart, and didn't satisfy that desire the way I wanted. Doing it for my Pok&eacute;mon team archive, though, actually does &mdash; because the colors are respective to the games, and are actually more necessary and relevant for these pages. I love design because so often it depends on function, and being able to scratch this I've had for making multi-color but interconnected webpages shows how integral function can be in design.</p>

<p>I chose Futura and Lato as the primary fonts of this site, due to their lightweight readability and having similar vibes as sans-serif fonts. Century Gothic was always one of my favorite fonts when I was younger, and Futura is like a more readable version of it. Lato works better for longer blocks of text. I also use Inconsolata as the main monospace font in the Gym area, though I'd actually made this site before I became obsessed with using Inconsolata on all my other websites too. This was just the beginning of it.</p>

<p>I made the gym second &mdash; and then the "Fight" section, because that's where I'd dump all I'd want to share about this site at the time. It was also fun to think of myself as a gym leader, though for a while there I was an ice-type leader &mdash; I swapped to steel sometime around 2020, because I realized that I am more drawn to steel-types as a type than anything. They're kind of similar in literal idea in a way, but Steel is better in a lot of ways. And I think I'm a lot better now in a lot of ways too. Even though my love for bisharp has dropped since the release of kingambit, but it still leads my gym team. I am a girl with a glass cannon in every respect, after all.</p>

<p>Then I had my issues with making the Bag/Town Map, but made it work sooner or later with my limited knowledge of Javscript, and a lot of handholding from StackExchange. Where would any of us be without StackExchange, especially when you're just a hobbyist.</p>

<p>After that I made the "flee" section, because I knew the Pok&eacute;Go section would take the longest, due to what I had in mind for it. The exit links out wasn't necessarily obviously easier, but I knew I wanted to use the similar ball theming as the front page, but make it a love ball because the exits would be sites/people I love. Though I suppose that isn't wholly accurate as they're largely strangers now, the idea is still there and I do still stand by it. Plus, having the love ball heart on the side is actually a pretty fun visual touch.</p>

<p>I like using text from the games too; it's a fun surprise when you're not really expecting it. And in the Pok&eacute;Go section, I kind of employ that idea for the full page &mdash; as if I'd translated the Pok&eacute;mon Go app into a webpage. I knew that's what I wanted to do because I knew I could do it, I would just need to get the appropriate graphics and make them myself. And honestly, despite the incredibly inefficiency with the images on this page, I think I was quite successful with it. And that it slaps.</p>

<p>The Pok&eacute;Go section was the last one I'd made because I knew how much graphical content it required especially in the editing department &mdash; not the dex, but the backgrounds and my avatar. The gradient background was also the first time I used it on a personal project as well, I believe, though I'd experimented with it before. The dex being based on seen/caught/unknown is a nice touch as well, though I think with 400 images on each page load now I may need to rethink it.</p>

<p>I didn't originally plan to have Favorites and the Shiny Gallery on my Trainer page. I do think I had the Miscellaneous page planned, though &mdash; I'd just beaten the Battle Maison in Omega Ruby to get my gold trainer badge and wanted to show it off. But having just Miscellaneous as an additional page on the trainer page looked awkward, and it quickly occurred to me that hey, there are a lot of other things about Pok&eacute;mon I really really like, so why not make a page of the other things I really really like? And then after making this website I got really obsessed with shiny hunting in Omega Ruby (and XY because I used the Pal Park) &mdash; I used to liveblog it on Plurk. So then I made a gallery of the small list of shinies at the time then too.</p>

<p>Since then, I've added pages for each new Pok&eacute;mon game I've played, though it's not a lot nor all the ones I've owned...oops. (I also really adore Pok&eacute;mon Snap, though I'm not sure how to make a webpage out of that.) I planned on playing Ultra Sun and didn't; and I still have my barely-played copy of Violet too. At least Let's Go and Shield were within a reasonable amount of time after I'd played them &mdash; it took me nearly 2 years to get the Legends Arceus section up after I'd played it. And it's still my favorite game.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's my process for making a new game page:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Decide on a color scheme/format &mdash; I may draw it, though I may not as the page organization is usually already preset.</li>
	<li>Find all the game-accurate sprites for my party.</li>
	<li>Find and make the game-accurate avatar for my in-game character.</li>
	<li>Copy the code for an existing game page and modify the code/HTML locally without any external spreadsheets, for decisive stylization purposes. If the game is on a new console, then think of a way the webpage can reflect the console's main gimmick.</li>
	<li>Write the blurb/meta and input my team's metadata, which honestly is a pain in the ass.</li>
	<li>Upload everything online.</li>
	<li>Translate all the stylization code into the CSS template and make sure the page works/looks good.</li>
	<li>Add the game in the footer.</li>
	<li>Add the game on the trainer page menu.</li>
	<li>As of 2024: Push through Github (Desktop), and then pull updated repo through cPanel</li>
</ol>

<p>With sections like these, I write all the actual page content in HTML first, and then convert it to a webpage and then push it through Github (Desktop) when I'm done. Writing is the most tedious part for me &mdash; I still love it though, but damn does it take time and energy and focus that I don't always have.</p> 

<p>This is also why Icirrus/Masterball has been online for 7 years, and I finally made it responsive in 2024 after wanting to clean my Exits and applying for some affiliation just so I had more buttons I could link from/to. I received a kind but critical email about how difficult it was to navigate this site, and though my initial instinct was, well that's the whole <i>point</i>, I realized that, well. Maybe I could make this site a little more comprehensible.</p>

<p>And so came the November 29, 2024 facelift of this site: transforming the index page, which originally had "Trainer" and "Gym" as navigation on the grey ball line, into a splash page that would open you up (via ball button) into a main navigation page instead. I had a few ideas for what the ball button would lead to &mdash; I'd actually made graphics for and configured it to be an interactive link &mdash; but this honestly feels so much better, because it makes sense, interaction-wise. It also makes it easier to see all the main sections of this site; <i>and</i> if I wanted to add something new, I wouldn't have to worry about it being in only one of two/three sections of Trainer/Gym/secret third thing. It would just go on this main navigation.</p>

<p>I was also made to think about how much I was willing to talk about myself &mdash; and it's been several years, so I'm a little more comfortable with writing about myself in long-form format. It's why I changed the Trainer "about" section into its own separate page, and wrote sections about my relationships with each of my favorite Pok&eacute;mon, which I didn't have before. I'd mostly sprinkled fun facts about myself and Pok&eacute;mon across multiple pages, but it does in fact make sense to have one large page instead of an in-page pop up for me to actually talk about myself as a player and fan of the game in more in-depth ways.</p>

<p>Another major change I made with this update was adding the Map, originally in the Gym/Bag section. Though the Gym/Bag/Map was fun, it wasn't really that efficient or easy to access. It also didn't really embody the idea of a "map" &mdash; but my current one does, and I'm really happy with it. For one, it has a PNG of the in-game town map. But for another, it shows the map in a stem form, which was CSS logic I totally nabbed from another site &mdash; since September I'd been obsessed with browsing and finding new personal sites again, and ran into several that had a sitemap constructed the same way, so when it came to making this page it wasn't hard for me to find the code that I wanted to borrow. So to speak.</p>

<p>Then was the Gym/Bag reorganizing. Now that I had a more functional map, the "Gym" one was basically redundant. And I thought, hey, I could just do the thing I wanted to do in the first place, with making the Bag an in-page thing. I understand Javascript (and coding in general) a lot better than I did in 2017, anyway. So for something that once took me several hours to do a pretty simple thing, implementing this change took me maybe all of 20 minutes. How much I've grown.</p>

<p>Lastly was making the site mobile responsive, which isn't that thrilling but is why I did all of this in the first place &mdash; I just saved it for the end. Responsive design, you may know, is my least favorite part of all this because I find it tedious despite knowing it's necessary. I will say it wasn't as bad for this site because it was actually pretty fun thinking of the ways each page could look on mobile, and a lot less time to implement due to how the page already worked in terms of scaling. I'd put it off for 7 years and had slotted it to take me 18 hours, but really it took me a morning and then some. And also 7 years of putting it off.</p>

<p>Of course, though the saga for now ends here, I'm always making tiny changes every so often. And I'll play Ultra Moon and Violet and update these docs to reflect that. Eventually. I'm just indecisive and lazy and have a ridiculous attention span, and not always in the best way.</p>

<h2 id="scrapped">Scrapped/Initial Plans</h2>

<p>Through all of this, this site has gone through some changes &mdash; and it may still in the future, who's to say. However, this documentation is relevant for how things are now past November 2024, so here are some noticeable things I've changed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The front page used to have navigation in the ball line instead of being a splash page. It also didn't have text in the middle to let you know where to go or what to click on.</li>
	<li>I originally had planned for there to be a "Someone's PC" option next to "Trainer" and "Gym" in the index page navigation. However, since I couldn't think of what to make "Someone's PC" to be (I think shrines/fanlistings when I was still interested and thought I cared enough to make them), I eventually scrapped the idea.</li>
	<li>Before it was mobile responsive, the mobile version of the front page was designed in a premier ball letting you know that this site was not mobile responsive yet.</li>
	<li>The NPC in my Trainer page as well as its accompanying gif in the "About" blurb used to be an Ace Trainer &mdash; but I eventually changed this when I contended with the fact that all things considered, I'm really not much of a battler. It's not to say I don't like it or I don't know how, but it never had my attention as much as the collecting and obsession I had with Pok&eacute;mon that were personal to me in some way. Being a Ranger fits this better, plus I always liked the Ranger aesthetic. The girl Ace Trainer was cute, but I don't think she's me.</li>
	<li>Fighting the gym used to have a contact form, though due to my own lack of knowledge/experience with PHP forms I decided to remove it. It wasn't very practical with the Javascript dropdown anyway; and we should bring back the art of the email.</li>
	<li>The Pok&eacute;Go portion used to have IRL "gyms" that I had conquered, but decided to remove it as it technically doxxed me (despite being public places, so not really.) Gyms in Go don't work like that anymore anyway, but if you are interested the code on the page still exists.</li>

	</ul>

<h2 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h2>

<p>Upon entering the site, the visitor gets presented with the image of a large masterball and the instruction to open it (or click on an adjoining link) to begin one's journey on the website.</p>

<p>Doing so will lead you to the main navigation, or Home &mdash; a hub of all the main subsections of this site. As of this moment, the active subsections are Trainer, Gym, and Map. The documentation and link back to the splash page (as well as the my primary website-making site, kingdra.net) are linked in the footer.</p>

<p>Trainer, which is listed at the top, is the main showcase of the site: a mini-archive of parties across all played games. Each page lists:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The name of the game</li>
	<li>The year played and name of the region</li>
	<li>A small blurb about my experience with the specific game</li>
	<li>My primary party of any playthroughs (usually one), including species, nickname, gender, ball caught, ability, nature/characteristics, IVs and ribbons (if relevant), and moves. Each Pok&eacute;mon's metadata is accompanied by a game-appropriate sprite.</li>
	<li>Additional interests and time-sinkers in the same playthrough, including shiny collecting or specific goals (like secret bases and trainer card colors.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Trainer also links to a small autobiographical section by "challenging" the trainer. Additional non-game links include Miscellaneous (non-main party Pok&eacute;mon that are significant to me), Favorites (of everything Pok&eacute;mon related), and my Shiny Gallery for relevant shinies.</p>

<p>Gym, the second listed page, is the more sitely aspect in two subpages, and another Pok&eacute;mon gallery in a "gym" subpage, just for fun and because I couldn't think of anything else to make the "Pok&eacute;mon" option in the menu. The gym is constructed to look and interact like a battle menu, with a gym guide from Pok&eacute;mon Emerald (my favorite game probably) as a sprite with tips on how to battle a steel gym leader.</p>

<p>Clicking "Fight" in the Gym will send you to the main site information page, which has a Javascript in-page menu of shiny pok&eacute;mon &mdash; because I have a shiny collection addiction &mdash; leading to:</p>

<ul><li>Where I log updates for the entire project (Github as well as masterball on Dreamwidth), via the bisharp</li>
	<li>My game contact information (3DS and Switch friend code), as well as how you can contact me if you decide to add me, via the aegislash.</li>
	<li>A broad overview of Pok&eacute;mon in my life, particularly in the present, via the mega aggron.</li>
	<li>A broad overview of this website, including the basic name information, via the excadrill.</li>
	<li>Linkback buttons, via the tinkaton</li>
	</ul>

<p>Clicking "Bag" in the Gym will send you to an in-page subpage of the bag, which opens up to a menu of quick links around the site. This is mostly used to function as a way out of this page, though I also think it's just fun to have and interact with. "Bicycle" is for flavor text, but "Town Map" sends you to the Map, "Vs. Seeker" sends you to Trainer, "Masterball x 1" sends you back to the home navigation, and closing the bag literally closes the bag.</p>

<p>Clicking "Bag" in the Gym will send you to the Pok&eacute;mon Go archive/log, which shows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In-game username, hydrasplatlings</li>
	<li>Current level</li>
	<li>Current avatar, though as of this moment I don't plan on changing it for a while because I like it a lot</li>
	<li>Go team, which is Team Valor and is themed in the page's design</li>
	<li>Trainer code</li>
	<li>Start date</li>
	<li>Pok&eacute;dex progress out of those I've seen, not of the total</li>
	</ul>

<p>Below is a pixel image-indicated dex log. You can hover over the empty spaces to see the unseen ones. The footer allows you to go back.</p>

<p>Clicking "Run" in the Gym will send you to exit links out &mdash; Pok&eacute;mon websites that I think are cool or useful, or some that I've affiliated with. There's no distinction here; I just like having a button wall. I also have links to Pok&eacute;mon sites that I linked here before that are no longer online, but have been preserved through the Wayback machine.</p>

<p>Returning back to the home navigation, there are presently links to two sections that do not yet exist, but are there both for the visitor informative purpose (that they will exist eventually), and as a promise/reminder to myself to make them as well.</p>

<p>The last link is the map to assist the user in navigation. The map's footer links to both the Github repository as well as the documentation.</p>

<h2 id="future">Future Plans</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Pok&eacute;Rogue section</li>
	<li>TCG section</li>
	<li>Take a photo of all my plushies to share here</li>
	<li>Add a Konami code secret</li>
	<li>Play Ultra Moon and Violet to make pages here</li>
	<li>Update or reconfigure the Go dex</li>
	<li>Change the gym team around again (maybe)</li>
	<li>Use root styles for trainer game pages instead of its current templating (maybe)</li>
	<li>Make a timeline (maybe)</li>
</ul>
