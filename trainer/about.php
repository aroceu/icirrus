			<div id="trainerinfo"><p style="clear: both;">Welcome to <i>Trainer</i>, the section of this website that cites my history with this game and all the precious Pok&eacute;mon I've caught and raised over the years. Since <ruby>Ruby</ruby> was the first real Pok&eacute;mon game I owned, I like to say that I'm a Hoenn kid at heart.</p>
	<p><img src="trainer.gif" class="trainerimg">I've been into Pok&eacute;mon since 1998, when the anime first came out; but I didn't actually own a game until August 2003 after watching my camp friends play it all summer. I really didn't know anything about the gameplay, but I was still so enthusiastic about it that some of my classmates gave me the nickname "Pok&eacute;mon Master" anyway.</p> 
	<p>Which I still am, by the way. My obsession for other things will come and go, but Pok&eacute;mon will always own at least 50% of my heart.</p>
	<p>Since then, I've played and owned at least one game in every generation that's come out. I'm behind on the anime, but I taught myself to memorize the original Kanto Pok&eacute;rap in 2018 because I'm still devoted to it. And my trainer name in nearly every game is in all caps, since that was how I named my first trainer. That way, as the years pass, the OT looks consistent.</p>
